The goal of the project is to carry out statistical significance tests to analyse the effect of independent variable menu on 
dependent variables time and error i.e. to figure out if menu types have a significant effect on time and error. Menu types are 4 different types of menu (controlmenu, flowmenu, toolpalette and toolglass) that were tested on a group of users and their 
time to use the menu as well as any errors while using the menu were noted. Conducting significance tests like ANOVA, MANOVA 
and T-Tests on this dataset helps us to determine if menu type has a significant effect on a variable and which menu type has 
the most significant effect. Also perform visualizations to understand the results better.
